# Overview
Please see the web for more detailes.

• Three Simulation Studies 1. Significance of Regression 2. Using RMSE for Selection? 3. Power 

• Introduction: This section fully provides background to each simulation such that a reader understands the purpose and goal of the simulation study.

• Methods: This section will contain the bulk of the R code that is used to generate the results. 

• Results: This section contains numerical or graphical summaries of the results as they pertain to the goal of each study.

• Discussion: This section provides a full discussion of the results. It includes my observations and analysis that tie the Introduction, Methods, and Results together. 


Note: The R and RMarkdown usage address the needs of the Methods section and produces what is displayed in the Results section.
Neatness and Organization of the Report and Rmd files.
